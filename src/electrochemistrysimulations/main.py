Description: 
This is the main file of the oscilloscope-reader package. All other files can be operated from 
here, although if it is necessary, many of the files can be operated individually from main.
 
===================================================================================================

How to use this file:
    
    1. Scroll down to the third point and choose the waveform you want to use, commenting out the 
       other waveform
    2. 
       d) If the window is set larger than the number of data points per interval, it can cause 
          distortion, whilst lower window values will leave some transient features
       e) In current sampling, the sampling window cannot be in the first or last 1% of an interval
    7. Scroll down to the sixth point and choose whether you want to display and/or save plots of 
       the analysed data
    8. Run the python file

The potential waveform data will be saved in a .txt file in the /data folder of the current working
directory, whilst the analysed oscilloscope data will be saved in a .txt file in the /analysis 
folder of the current working directory. If saved, the plotted data will be saved in a .png file in
the /plots folder of the current working drectory.
