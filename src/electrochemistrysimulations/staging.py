Package title:      electrochemistry-simulations
Repository:         https://github.com/MoonshinetheP/electrochemistry-simulations
Date of creation:   09/03/2023
Main author:        Steven Linfield (MoonshinetheP)

Filename:           simulations.py

===================================================================================================

Description:

This is the main simulation module of the electrochemistry-simulations package and can be used to 
generate simulations of diffusion-based electrochemical reactions. The module uses the output of 
the waveforms module to prepare a .txt file containing the time, potential, and current. 

===================================================================================================

How to use this file:
    
    1.  Scroll down to the section titled 'RUNNING THE SIMULATION FROM MAIN' (near the bottom)
    2.  Describe the waveform using the appropriate class from the waveforms (wf) module
    3.  Define the parameters of the simulation in the 'Diffusive' class
    4.  Run the file in Python
    
The programme will attempt to make a new folder in the current working directory to keep all the 
data. The name of this folder is /data by default, but this can be edited. If the /data folder 
already exists, then this programme will save data into this folder.

===================================================================================================

Note:

The code within this file is split into several sections. Each section starts with a title and a 
brief description of what the code within it does. Comments are placed throughout the code, with 
one hashtag (#) indicating a description of what the code below does and two hashtags (##) 
indicating the formal definition of a variable.
